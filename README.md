# Wikipedia Viewer

The wikipedia viewer project will allow the user to do a search using the Wikipedia Search API. The viewer will return the 10 most pertinent results from the search and display those for the user which can be clicked to redirect to the corresponding wikipedia page. The user can also click the 'Random Article' button to see a random article on wikipedia.

## To Use

Enter your search query into the input field and hit enter or click the 'Search' button. Alternatively, click the 'Random Article' button.
